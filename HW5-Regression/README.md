# Deep Learning for Regression Analysis

## 📌 Overview
A foundational Deep Learning project aimed at solving a regression problem. The objective is to predict continuous target variables based on a set of input features using a **Deep Neural Network (DNN)**.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- **Language:** Python 3
- **Framework:** PyTorch
- **Libraries:** Pandas, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib

## 🚀 Key Features
- **Data Preprocessing:** Handled missing values, feature scaling (normalization), and dataset splitting.
- **Model Architecture:** Designed a **Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)** with adjustable hidden layers and activation functions (ReLU).
- **Optimization:** Implemented Gradient Descent optimization (Adam/SGD) and tuned hyperparameters to minimize MSE Loss.

## 📖 How to Run
1. Run `hw5_code.ipynb` to train the model.
2. Visualize the loss curve to monitor convergence.
