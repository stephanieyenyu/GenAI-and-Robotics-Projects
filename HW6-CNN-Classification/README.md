# CNN Image Classification

## Overview
This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify characters from the anime series "BanG Dream!". It demonstrates the application of deep learning in computer vision tasks.

## Tech Stack
* **Language:** Python 3
* **Framework:** PyTorch, Torchvision
* **Model:** Custom CNN Architecture / ResNet (Transfer Learning)

## Key Features
* **Data Augmentation:** Applied transformations such as Rotation, Flipping, and Cropping to solve the issue of limited training data.
* **CNN Architecture:** Built a network with Conv2d, MaxPool2d, and Batch Normalization layers.
* **Performance Tuning:** Experimented with different optimizers and learning rate schedulers.

## How to Run
1. Prepare the image dataset.
2. Run hw6_code.ipynb to train the CNN and evaluate accuracy.
